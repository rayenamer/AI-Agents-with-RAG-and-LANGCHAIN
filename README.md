# AI Agents with RAG and LangChain

## Overview

This repository contains implementations and experiments with AI Agents using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LangChain. The project explores various techniques in natural language processing, prompt engineering, and information retrieval to build more capable and context-aware AI systems.

## Contents

- `RAG with Pytorch-v1.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook implementing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) using PyTorch
- `RAG-v1.ipynb`: Basic implementation of RAG architecture
- `introduction to langchain-v1.ipynb`: Tutorial and examples for working with LangChain framework
- `prompt-engineering-v1.ipynb`: Experiments and best practices for effective prompt engineering

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyTorch
- LangChain
- Other dependencies listed in requirements.txt (if available)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Agents-with-RAG-and-LANGCHAIN.git
   cd AI-Agents-with-RAG-and-LANGCHAIN
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

   ```

## Usage

Open any of the Jupyter notebooks to explore the implementations:

1. Start with `introduction to langchain-v1.ipynb` for LangChain basics
2. Explore `prompt-engineering-v1.ipynb` for prompt design techniques
3. Examine the RAG implementations in `RAG-v1.ipynb` and `RAG with Pytorch-v1.ipynb`
